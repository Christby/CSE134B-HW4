1. I let the navigation bar stay on the top of the screen.

2. For the "University of California - San Diego" under the education, I made it a link that directs to the UCSD homepage so that people can view basic information about this school.

3. For the "Relavent Coursework" on the right of the education background, I made it a link that directs to the CSE course catalog so that people can see what the courses are about instead of only seeing the broad topics about computer science I provided.

4. For the submit buttons on the homepage and the skill page, I added an alert message to say thanks to people that is willing to leave their comment or information for me. 

5. I also changed the style of the above two links when hovering them, the changes in font size and color remind the users that this is a link that they can click on to view more information.

6. For the 3rd party script tag, I added a Google Analytics to my website, the code is in the head of my index.html file. This function is very useful since I would be able to check the browsing history of my personal portfolio by differne users. Also I can see the location of the users and have a general idea how my site is doing and if I should make any changes to make it more popular.
